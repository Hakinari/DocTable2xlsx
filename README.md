# DocTable2xlsx

This script export the word tables to xlsx.

This script will get all the tables from the word .doc and export to an excel .xlsx.

To use the script you just need tip the comand "python  doc_table2xlsx file.doc".
  - By default the xlsx will be generated adding all tables at the same sheet.

Also you can add the flag "-m" before the filename to separate each table on different sheets.

The script will export the table at the same order that they are on the .doc.

BUG. A char can appear at the xlsx cell.
